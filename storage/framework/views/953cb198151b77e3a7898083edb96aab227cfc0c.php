                             <p>Our mission is to give people the power to build a play community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you:</p>

                                   <p><strong>Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:</strong> We help you find and connect with people, products, companies and others that matter to you across the People of Play Products that you use. We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others – for example, products to watch, events to attend and people who you may want to connect with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful when people are connected to people, products and companies that they care about.</p>

                                   <p><strong>Combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community:</strong> People will only build community on People of Play if they feel safe. We employ teams around the world and develop basic technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action – for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data with Chicago Toy and Game Group when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.</p>

Our Data Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.</p>

Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘licence') to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above. Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you share a photo on People of Play, you give us permission to store, copy and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other People of Play Products you use. This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. Learn more about how to delete your account. You can download a copy of your data at any time before deleting your account.

                                   <p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. We will only make changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests. We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least <span class="text-danger"> 30 days</span> before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products. We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be part of the People of Play community, you can delete your account at any time by writing to us.</p>

                                   <p>We want People of Play to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas. If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons. Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think that we have disabled your account by mistake. If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, <span class="text-danger">but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.</span></p>

                                   <p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is", and we make no guarantees that they will always be safe, secure or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also <span class="text-uppercase">DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</span> We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content that they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful and other objectionable content). We cannot predict when issues may arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstances will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the People of Play Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

                                   <p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply. If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the People of Play Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. <span class="bg-warning">ADD MARY’S COUNTY TO SETTLE DISPUTE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY IS $100 In </span> <span class="text-danger">In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County.

For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, managing a profile for your company, or using our measurement services, you agree to our Commercial Terms. If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines: You are responsible for the content you post. You may not use videos on our Products to create a music listening experience. Unauthorized content may be removed.

You may not be able to post or access videos containing music in every country of the world. To the extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict. </p>

                             <p>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.

We also process information about you across the People of Play Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their Terms and Policies. For example, we process information from POP Messaging about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on People of Play, Chicago Toy & Game Group or POP messaging. We also work to understand how people use and interact with People of Play Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different People of Play Company Products.</p>

                             <p class="mb-0"><strong>How can I manage or delete information about me?</strong></p>

                             <p>We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and People of Play Products or until your account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated. Learn more about deletion of content that you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.</p>
